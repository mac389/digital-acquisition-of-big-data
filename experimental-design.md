1. Brith weight
2. Et al. 

**Approach**

### Types of additional data we are looking for:
  - geographic data (Twitter, Instagram, ~~Bulletin Boards~~) 
  - What type of  {Twitter | Instagram} users display their location? 
  - Am I going to analyze images or the text from images (on Instagram)?
  - What methods will work for both Twitter and Instagram?
  - What if people have multiple accounts on {Twitter | Instagram}?
  - What do I do with deleted accounts? (Is this a longitudinal or cross-sectional study?)
  - Individual vs corporate accounts? Celebrities? Sponsored (Promoted) Tweets?
  - What about retweets/shares?  (Probably not relatable to original data)
  
### Thinking about the query
 - use NYC 311 queries (in uppercase and lower case)
 -  `q: ["noise"] `
 
 ### Data Validation
   - looking for certain events 
   
 ### Data Stewardship
   - End Use License Agreement
   - FB is more restrictive (permission from each user for each app)
   - No resharing outside research group
   - Differential privacy
